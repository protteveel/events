## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- macOS (for specific system integration features like sound alerts)

### Setup

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the repository or downloading the source code to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/protteveel/events
   cd events-notification
   ```

2. **Configure the Application**

   Edit the `events.ini` file to customize logging, notification intervals, sound alerts, and other settings according to your preferences.

3. **Schedule Your Events**

   Update the `events.json` file with your scheduled events. Each event should include a time, description, and duration, structured as follows:

   ```json
   [
       {"time": "HH:MM", "description": "Your Event Description", "duration": "HH:MM"}
   ]
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Events Notification Application, follow these steps to set up a Python virtual environment, activate it, and run the program:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (if you haven't already):

   Navigate to the root directory of the application and create a virtual environment named `env`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   Activate the virtual environment to use the application's specific Python and package setup:

   ```bash
   . env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   With the virtual environment activated, start the application by running:

   ```bash
   python3 ./events.py
   ```

The application will now run in the background, providing notifications for your scheduled events at the specified times.

### Terminating the Application

To stop the Events Notification Application:

1. **Terminate the Program**:

   Use the `<control><c>` key combination in the terminal where the application is running to terminate it.

2. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**:

   After terminating the program, deactivate the virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

This will return your terminal to its normal state, outside the application's virtual environment.

## Why This Program?
